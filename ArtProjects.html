                <br> <br>
                Light Sources are a standard concept in art and design as nothing can
                look real if their shadows are wrong or even nonexsistent!
                Therefore, this art is one of the most important and crucial. The
                lack of colors was due to it being my introductory assignment and to
                make it easier, it was only a gray scale.

                <div class = "centerText"> Color and Hue</div> 
                <br> <br>
                The next step was introducing color and hue into the equation.
                This art piece allowed me to understand how color and backlighting 
                can influence the overall theme of the piece.

            <div> <div class = "centerText"> Colored Light Source</div> 
                <br> <br>
                Increasing the difficulty, we now combine the past two concepts 
                to show a more solidified light source. Having to think about where 
                the source is and how both spheres would be affected was challenging 
                however after working it out, the piece has depth and definition.

                Finally, taking all lessons I have previously demonstrated, I was tasked 
                with picking an animal or object to draw and depict. I used a slug due to 
                the giant shell that would cast a shadow on anything behind it.
