                A quick little look into my life! My achievements have been listed in this
                section as well as my current education and aspirations for the future.
                One of my achievements recently has been getting elected into my fraternity's 
                executive board. This has proven to be extremely useful to show both leadership 
                and excellence.</div>

                The art projects I have accumulated over the years and over classes that I 
                have taken. I hope to demonstrate my comprehension of art concepts and themes.</div>

                My major, Games and Interactive Media, has allowed me to work with others to 
                create exciting and innovative video games. This section consists of some of 
                the games I have made while attending college and classes.
