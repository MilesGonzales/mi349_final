                My goal is to show my talents as a game designer while still showing my
                ability to learn from experiences. Making assets and games may be difficult
                but no matter how many we make, there is always something to learn from all
                of them.

                In addition to being a game design student, I have been a prominent member of my
                fraternity, Sigma Tau Gamma. My previous job within the fraternity was as Head New 
                Member educator in which I was tasked with helping our new members be acquainted with
                our structure and brotherhood. <br><br>
                Our organization was awarded "Chapter of the Year" at Michigan State University this
                year for showing an outstanding performance in philanthropy, leadership, and brotherhood.
                I was recently elected to the Executive Board for the position, Director of 
                Education & Wellness. <br><br>
                During my time on Executive Board, I plan on helping my brothers by promoting mental 
                health resources as well as facilitating a prosperous learning environment by offering 
                academic resources.

                I currently attend Michigan State University located in East Lansing, Michigan. 
                My current major is in Games and Interactive Media. I hope to find a job in the 
                game design field once I graduate in 2023. My dream job would be either level 
                design or creative design within a semi-large gaming company.
